MakerFarm Prusa i3v (12 Inch Version)

Colin at MakerFarm provided the source to the MakerFarm i3v 3D Printer (a lasercut variant of the Prusa i3 printer with v-slot linear rails instead of rods) in a closed .pwj format. I have converted it to a more open format for those of us that wish to view the file. The source is provided in .pwj, .plt and .dxf formats.

If others encounter a .pwj file, it can be opened with a program called LaserGRAV:

LaserGRAV can then export the file in .plt format, which in turn can be opened in Inkscape and converted to whatever format you require.
